Hi!

Thank you for purchasing my assets!

Every gun has it's own folder in the Assets/Stylized Guns/Models/

There's an ExamplePrefabs folder with the ready to use prefabs, which work with the simple bonus first person shooter controller.
To see it in action simply open the SampleScene which is placed in the Assets/Stylized Guns/Demo folder.

Use Unity's Post Processing with the provided profile in the Demo folder if you want to achieve the same visuals.

If you use HDRP/URP you only need to use Unity's material converter that embeded in these pipelines.

I will be happy if you rate this pack at the Asset Store!
